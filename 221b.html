                <h1>A Study in Scarlet</h1>
                <br><br>
                <p>A Study in Scarlet is an 1887 detective novel by British author 
                Arthur Conan Doyle. Written in 1886, the story marks the first 
                appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become the most 
                famous detective duo in popular fiction. The book's title derives from a 
                speech given by Holmes, a consulting detective, to his friend and 
                chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes 
                the story's murder investigation as his "study in scarlet":</p>

                <blockquote><p class="quote">Every generation or so, some kind of cycle happens, 
                some big book or movie begins to start the process and then others 
                seem to follow up.</p></blockquote>
                <p class="quote center">＊＊＊</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The story, and its main characters, attracted little public 
                interest when it first appeared. Only 11 complete copies of 
                the magazine in which the story first appeared, Beeton's Christmas 
                Annual for 1887, are known to exist now and they have considerable 
                value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories featuring Holmes, 
                A Study in Scarlet is one of only four full-length novels in the 
                original canon. The novel was followed by The Sign of the Four, 
                published in 1890. A Study in Scarlet was the first work of detective 
                fiction to incorporate the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.</p>
