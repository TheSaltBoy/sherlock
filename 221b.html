        <h1>221b Baker Street</h1>

        <p>221B Baker Street is the London address of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, 
        created by the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

        <p>At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not go 
        as high as 221. In fact, number 85 was the last number of the street in 1890.</p>

        <p>Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the Abbey National Building Society 
        moved into premises at 219–229 Baker Street. For many years, Abbey National employed a 
        full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes.</p>

        <h1>The Sherlock Holmes Museum</h1>

        <p>In 1990, a blue plaque signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock 
        Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same block, and there followed a 15-year dispute 
        between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to 
        221B Baker Street.</p>

        <p>Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Sherlock 
        Holmes Museum has not been challenged. The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an 
        1815 townhouse very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between 
        237 and 241 Baker Street.</p>

        <p>The museum displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with 
        the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum.</p>

        <p>The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 
        steps leading from the ground-floor hallway to the first-floor study. In 'A Study in 
        Scarlet' (1887), Conan Doyle writes:</p>

        <blockquote>We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, 
        Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of 
        comfortable bedrooms and a single large airy sitting room, cheerfully furnished, and 
        illuminated by two broad windows.</blockquote>

        <p>There is now a museum on Baker Street, The Sherlock Holmes Museum. Open daily from 
        9.30 am - 6pm, admission is £15 for adults and £10 for children under 16.</p>
