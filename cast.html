                <h3 class="heading">Sherlock Holmes</h3>

                <p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by British author
                Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Known as a 'consulting detective' in the stories, Holmes
                is known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning
                that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide
                variety of clients, including Scotland Yard. Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a 
                penchant for papier maché.</p>

                <p>First appearing in print in 1887 in 'A Study in Scarlet', the character's popularity 
                became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, 
                beginning with 'A Scandal in Bohemia' in 1891. Additional tales appeared from then until 
                1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories.</p>

                <p>All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian periods, taking place between about 
                1880 to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer 
                Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his investigations and often shares 
                quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories 
                begin.</p>

                <h3 class="heading">Dr Watson</h3>

                <p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to 
                Mary Watson and is arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

                <p>In the debut Holmes story 'A Study in Scarlet', Watson, as the narrator, describes 
                meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to 
                discover the profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson 
                into his confidence, and the events surrounding their first case together. Watson 
                describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner for Holmes' 
                taste. In time, they become close friends.</p>

                <p>In 'The Sign of Four', John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife. Mary seemed 
                somewhat less sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him 'James' in the 
                short story 'The Man With the Twisted Lip'.</p>

                <p>This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated that it is a 
                wifely reference to Watson's unknown middle name, which could have been 'Hamish' 
                (Scottish for 'James'). Dorothy Sayers, creator of the detective Lord Peter Wimsey, 
                who also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later publishing this theory 
                in 'Unpopular Opinions'.</p>

                <h3 class="heading">Moriarty</h3>

                <p>Professor James Moriarty, the arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics 
                professor turned the world's only 'consulting criminal'. His genius is equal to, if not 
                perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.</p>

                <p>Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the 
                'Napoleon of crime'. Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who 
                was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, who is one of the 
                individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.</p>

                <p>The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to 
                kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>

                <p>Moriarty is a genius, a philosopher and an abstract thinker, with a brain of the 
                first order. As Holmes puts it: "He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its 
                web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of 
                them."</p>

                <p>Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been proven to be the most 
                dangerous of all criminals that Holmes encounters. In the short story 'The Adventure of 
                the Final Problem', during a fight with Holmes above the Reichenbach Falls, Moriarty 
                falls to his death.</p>

                <h3 class="heading">Irene Adler</h3>

                <p>Irene Adler, professionally known as 'The Woman', is a brilliant dominatrix who has an 
                apparently romantic attraction to Sherlock Holmes.</p>

                <p>Whilst Mycroft – Holmes' elder brother (by seven years) – is telling Sherlock about 
                Irene, he states that she is a dominatrix who gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. 
                She has been in the middle of two political scandals in recent years, one of them 
                involving a famous author, in which she had an affair with both sides.</p>

                <p>She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John are summoned to Buckingham 
                Palace by Mycroft and are asked to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken 
                compromising images of a young female member of the British Royal family during a 
                dominatrix session.</p>

                <p>Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock is tasked in 
                getting them back. She is using them, and other information for her 'protection'.</p>
